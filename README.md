# Denarii Labs Website Revamp

This project is a proof-of-concept aimed at enhancing the Denarii Labs website with a modern tech stack and an improved user experience. The goal was to rebuild key sections of the site using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS (with shadcn/ui) to showcase frontend development skills.

While the full site migration is a work in progress, this repository contains the foundational work and several key, fully-styled pages.
